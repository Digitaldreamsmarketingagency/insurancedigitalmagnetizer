    <h4 class="title_custom">Eligiblity</h4>
    <p>When you apply for the Parent and Grandparent Super Visa, you must provide proof that you purchased medical insurance coverage (known as Super Visa insurance, Super Visa Medical Insurance, Super Visa Health Insurance) from a Canadian insurance company. The Super Visa insurance coverage must:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Be valid for a minimum period of one year from the date of entry to Canada</li>
    <li>Provide a minimum of $100,000 coverage</li>
    <li>Must cover health care, hospitalization and repatriation costs (the costs to return you to your home country, if necessary)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each parent or grandparent must have insurance coverage. The policy must be valid for each entry to Canada, and must be readily available for review by point of entry officers.</p>
    <h4 class="title_custom">Health Insurance</h4>
    <p>On December 1st, 2011, the conservative government had finally come with an impressive plan of a new type of visa called the "Super Visa" for parents and grandparents of immigrants and Canadian citizens. This plan was initiated with a motive of clearing the vast backlog of about 165,000 parents and grandparents who are trying to join family in Canada. Parents and grandparents aspiring to visit their loved ones in Canada after applying are granted a 10 years visa which will have to be renewed after a period of 2 years. The main concern of the government is that the applicants wanting to apply for Super Visa is that they or their children who are sponsoring them will have to purchase a private Canadian health insurance, a basic plan that covers each parent up to $ 100,000 during their stay in Canada. Individuals sponsoring their parent or grandparent will have to show they can support their visiting relatives. When the NDP Critic criticized the government's policy and commented that people who have applied for permanent residencies will be denied visa on the ground that they will not return back to their home country after landing in Canada. The government however made it clear that those who have applied for permanent residencies will be granted visa if the conditions are satisfied by the applicant.</p>
    <p>Immigration Minister Jason Kenney says that won't be a problem - people who have applied for permanent residency will definitely be eligible for the visa. The immigration department has also stated that the actual rate of acceptance is going to be very high. The minister has also made it clear that the new health insurance requirement may make it easier for visa officers to say "yes." So with the Super Visa effective from today i.e. December 1st, 2011 is a golden opportunity to all the immigrants and Canadian citizens to reunite with their loved ones. Punjab Insurance Inc. supports applicants aspiring to visit their loved ones by offering affordable quotes. We understand your language and your sentiments allow us to serve you with the right plan.</p>
